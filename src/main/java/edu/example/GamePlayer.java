//A game can have multiple players and a player can be in multiple games
//The GamePlayer table associates the players to their games
// Because game and player are references to objects stored in other data tables,
// you need to add JPA annotations to tell JPA how to connect the tables together.


/*For each row of the pet database table, include a column owner_id with the ID of the owner of the pet.
Given a pet, you can get the owner by retrieving the person with the stored owner_id.
Given a person, you can get all that person's pets by collecting all the rows of the pet table that have that person's ID in the owner_id column.

In JPA, we do this by


annotating this field with JPA to link it to the data table
define getOwner()  and setOwner() methods */
